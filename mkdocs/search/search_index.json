Under the hood the toolbox had an important polishing, and the small manual intervention required by this new release match the new features which have been developed. You can read Release Notes for a detailed overview. Below are described only the steps required to port Simulink models to this new release. New toolbox configuration \u00b6 The WB-Toolbox 2.0 was based on top of yarpWholeBodyInterface , which configuration was stored in a yarpWholeBodyInterface.ini file. This file was retrieved by ResourceFinder and its information was then loaded into the toolbox. Store the configuration in the Simulink model \u00b6 WB-Toolbox 3.0 deprecated the support of yarpWholeBodyInterface , and for reducing the complexity and sparsity of the information storage it allows configuring a Simulink model from the model itself. The new Configuration block allows inserting information such as Robot Name , URDF Name , Controlled Joints , ... directly from the block's mask. Load the configuration from the Workspace \u00b6 Sometimes it might be useful loading the model's configuration directly from the Workspace. For this purpose, a new WBToolbox.WBToolboxConfig class has been developed. The Configuration block needs to know only the name of the variable which refers to the object. Its data is then read before the simulation runs. This snippet of code shows an example of how to initialize a configuration object: # Initialize a config object WBTConfigRobot = WBToolbox . WBToolboxConfig ; # Insert robot data WBTConfigRobot . RobotName = 'icubSim' ; WBTConfigRobot . UrdfFile = 'model.urdf' ; WBTConfigRobot . ControlledJoints = { ... 'torso_pitch' , 'torso_roll' , 'torso_yaw' , ... 'r_shoulder_pitch' , 'r_shoulder_roll' , 'r_shoulder_yaw' , 'r_elbow' , ... 'l_shoulder_pitch' , 'l_shoulder_roll' , 'l_shoulder_yaw' , 'l_elbow' }; WBTConfigRobot . ControlBoardsNames = { 'torso' , 'left_arm' , 'right_arm' }; WBTConfigRobot . LocalName = 'WBT' ; To check if the data has been read correctly, it is displayed as read-only in the block's mask. Furthermore, a good sign for a valid configuration is the WBTConfigRobot.ValidConfiguration property. Multi-robot support \u00b6 The scope of the introduction of the Configuration block goes beyond the need of a simpler toolbox configuration. One of the biggest limitation of the 2.0 version is the support of controlling only one robot per model . WB-Toolbox 3.0 is now capable of reading / sending data from / to multiple robots. Multiple Configuration blocks can be present in the same model attaining to the following rules: In the same hierarchical level of a Simulink model, only one Configuration block should be present. In other words, you should never see in the display more than one Configuration block. Configuration blocks put deeper in the hierarchy (e.g. in a Subsystem) override the previous ones. There are a few pitfalls which are worth to be highlighted: It is legit having two Subsystems with different Configuration blocks which point to the same robot. They can have for instance a different joint list and use different control boards. Although, despite reading information never creates problems, sending data to the robot in such scenario can be disastrous. In fact, consider the case these two subsystems share one link, and configure it in two different control modes (e.g. Position and Torque). Sending references to this link causes unpredictable effects. In line of theory it would be possible to have two subsystems in which the first one refers to a Gazebo model and the second one to a real robot. However, this case causes unpredictable behaviour for what concerns the synchronization. In fact, two different blocks for such aim are present in the toolbox: Simulator Synchronizer and Real Time Syncronizer . They should be always used exclusively. Other manual edits \u00b6 All the Get Estimate blocks need to be replaced by the new Get Measurement block. All the hardcoded digital filters (e.g. for the joints velocities) have been removed. A new Discrete Filter block has been developed, and it should be manually added if the read raw signal (e.g. from the Get Measurement block) requires filtering. The C++ class used by the DoFs Converter changed. All the blocks in the YARP To WBI configuration need to be connected again. The gravity vector is stored is the WBToolboxConfig class. If an alternative value is needed, set it globally directly in the configuration object or scope the block which needs it in a Subsystem with its own Configuration block. In order to set the low level PIDs, loading in the Workspace a WBToolbox.WBTPIDConfig object should be configured as follows: # Initialize an empty object pids = WBToolbox . WBTPIDConfig ; # Insert data pids . addPID ( WBToolbox . PID ( 'l_elbow' , WBToolbox . PID ( 1 , 1 , 0 ))); pids . addPID ( WBToolbox . PID ( 'l_wrist_pitch' , WBToolbox . PID ( 1.5 , 0 , 0.1 ))); pids . addPID ( WBToolbox . PID ( 'r_shoulder_pitch' , WBToolbox . PID ( 0.2 , 0 , 0 ))); pids . addPID ( WBToolbox . PID ( 'torso_roll' , WBToolbox . PID ( 0.1 , 0.1 , 0 ))); If some of the controlled joints are not specified, the PIDs are kept in their default values. Deprecations \u00b6 Inverse Kinematics and Remote Inverse Kinematics have been temporary deprecated. They will see a major release in the coming months. If you need them please do not upgrade to the 3.0 version. Set Low Level PID block lost the capability of switching between multiple configurations. Since they were stored in an external file, this change is aligned to the simplification process chosen for for the configuration.","title":"From WB-Toolbox 2.0"},{"location":"Migration_from_WB-Toolbox_2.0/#from-wb-toolbox-20-to-wb-toolbox-3","text":"Most of the major changes delivered with the 3.0 version of the WB-Toolbox don't affect directly the end-user.

However, there are some things the user should take care while doing this operation. This guide points out the main differences between the two toolboxes. For more information about the WBI-Toolbox, please have a look at the WBI-Toolbox README . This guide follows the WBI and WB Toolbox blocks partitioning in Simulink library. It is divided in the following sections: Required variables Utilities wholeBodyActuators wholeBodyModel wholeBodyStates Required variables \u00b6 As explained in the WB-Toolbox README , first of all the user should define the following variables: - WBT_modelName - WBT_wbiList - WBT_wbiFilename - WBT_robotName They have already meaningful default values. Nevertheless you should take a look at at least the following two variables: - WBT_modelname = 'matlabTorqueBalancing' or be careful that the default name does not conflicts with any other modules or YARP ports - WBT_wbiList = 'ROBOT_TORQUE_CONTROL_JOINTS_WITHOUT_PRONOSUP' if you simulate a 23-DoFs iCub robot Floating base position estimate \u00b6 In the WB-Toolbox the world-to-base homogeneous transformation matrix is not calculated inside each block, but it must be provided from the Simulink model as a block input. The world-to-base homogeneous transformation matrix is a 4x4 matrix that maps position and orientation of a rigid body from an initial frame of reference to another. For back-compatibility, the transformation happending under the hood in the WBI-Toolbox can be obtained using forward kinematics blocks as in the following example: where forward kinematics is used to compute the transformation matrices from world to the left foot and from world to the root link, while the desired transformation matrix is obtained as a matrices product, using the homogeneous transformation matrix properties. Utilities \u00b6 In this section the user should note that: - the Minimum Jerk Trajectory Generator block has now only the reference trajectory as input. The initial value is automatically taken at startup. - Yarp Read and some other blocks require now the WBT_modelName instead of the localName variable. wholeBodyActuators \u00b6 Instead of having different blocks for each kind of control mode, only one block is now present.

Furthermore, the base frame pose and velocity and the joint configuration are now separate inputs. Jacobians \u00b6 There is now only one generic block for jacobians and one for dJdq calculation. The link with respect to which the Jacobian is computed is determined by its frame name as specified in the URDF model . As for the dynamics, the base pose and velocity and the joint position and velocity are required as input. Kinematics \u00b6 As for the section Jacobians , there is now only one generic block for forward kinematics computation. World-to-base homogeneous transformation matrix and joint position are the required input. wholeBodyStates \u00b6 As in the previous section, one generic block is used, from which the user can estimate joint position, velocity and acceleration and joint torques.

Dependencies \u00b6 Install the required and the optional dependencies by following their installation instructions. These instructions need that blockfactory , YARP , iDynTree , YCM and Eigen3 packages can be found by CMake using find_package . Warning If an optional dependency is not found, the classes depending on it are not compiled. However, in the Simulink Library the blocks do not disappear. They will just not work, raising an appropriate error. Setup Matlab \u00b6 Matlab and Simulink are not required to build the WBT plugin. However, through blockfactory the plugin library shipped in this repository can be loaded inside a Simulink model. WBT provides a Simulink Library that exposes all the C++ blocks of the plugin to Simulink, wrapping them in user-friendly masks. Info Despite the blocks can be used directly from C++, this usage is not very user friendly. Simulink and alternative visual tools are very convenient solutions to connect blocks together, but nothing prevents using the provided blocks exploiting the blockfactory interfaces. From now on, we assume that you want to use Simulink since it is the most common use case. For developers \u00b6 Developers of WBT must have Simulink installed in order to operate on the provided Simulink Library. Make sure that CMake is able to find your Matlab installation , or manually set the Matlab_ROOT_DIR environment variable if needed. Download, build and install \u00b6 If all the dependencies are met, proceed with the following instructions: Commands Substitute to <install-prefix> the absolute path where you want to install the project. ````tab=\"GNU / Linux and macOS\" git clone robotology/wb-toolbox.git mkdir -p wb-toolbox/build && cd wb-toolbox/build cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= cmake --build . cmake --build . --target install ````tab=\"Windows\" git clone https://github.com/robotology/wb-toolbox.git mkdir -p wb-toolbox/build && cd wb-toolbox/build cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-prefix> cmake --build . --config Release cmake --build . --config Release --target install Configuration \u00b6 Plugin \u00b6 In order to use Whole-Body Toolbox, the dynamic loader of the operating system should be able to find the plugin library. Add the folder <install-prefix>/lib/blockfactory to the following environment variable depending on the OS: GNU / Linux macOS Windows LD_LIBRARY_PATH DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH Path Matlab \u00b6 In order to use the WBT in Matlab you have to add some folders to the Matlab path. If you usually launch Matlab from the command line, exporting the following environment variable should be enough: export MATLABPATH = <install-prefix>/mex:<install-prefix>/share/WBToolbox:<install-prefix>/share/WBToolbox/images If, instead, you use the desktop launcher, a non-persistent Matlab configuration is the following: addpath ([ '<install-prefix>' / mex ]) addpath ( genpath ([ '<install-prefix>' / share / WBToolbox ])) We also provide for the latter scenario a persistent configuration of WBT . After the installation, run once the startup_wbitoolbox.m script that you can find in the <install-prefix>/share/WBToolbox directory. It will place a file pathdef.m in your userpath that loads the right variables to Matlab's environment. Note that this usage assumes that Matlab is always launched from the userpath folder . Environment \u00b6 Each robot that can be used with WBT has its own configuration files. WBT uses the YARP 's ResourceFinder for finding files in the file system. You should thus follow the related instructions to properly configure your installation (e.g. setting the YARP_DATA_DIRS and YARP_ROBOT_NAME variables). Install using the robotology-superbuild \u00b6 The robotology/robotology-superbuild provides an easy way for users to setup an environment by downloading, compiling, installing all the projects together. Follow the superbuild installation instructions and enable the ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS profile. If WBT is not downloaded and built, check that ROBOTOLOGY_USES_MATLAB is ON and ROBOTOLOGY_NOT_USE_SIMULINK is OFF . The configuration of the environment should be straightforward following the Configure your environment and Matlab sections.","title":"Install"},{"location":"install/#install","text":"Disclaimer WBT has been widely tested on Ubuntu 16:04 and Ubuntu 18.04 with Matlab R2017b .

Note YARP and iDynTree are not both strictly required. Most of the code is independent from the two individually, and in theory these two components can be separated, providing the possibility for instance of using only the iDynTree blocks.

It explains how to configure a Simulink model to be compatible with real-time usage and shows an example that involves signal filtering. Tutorial 2: Using model blocks : This tutorial introduces the usage of the iDynTree blocks used to compute canonical robotics quantities through rigid-body dynamics.
