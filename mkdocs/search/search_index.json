Most of the code is independent from the two individually, and in theory these two components can be separated, providing the possibility for instance of using only the iDynTree blocks. Though, we use YARP to find files in the filesystem, including the <code>urdf</code> of the model. For this reason, we still require both to be installed in the system. Running the <code>yarpserver</code> is not necessary if YARP is not required during runtime.</p> <ul> <li>Tutorial 1: Basic real-time Simulink Model: This tutorial represents a primer for new users. It explains how to configure a Simulink model to be compatible with real-time usage and shows an example that involves signal filtering.</li> <li>Tutorial 2: Using model blocks: This tutorial introduces the usage of the iDynTree blocks used to compute canonical robotics quantities through rigid-body dynamics.
