For this purpose, a new \nWBToolbox.WBToolboxConfig\n class has been developed. The \nConfiguration\n block needs to know only the name of the variable which refers to the object. Its data is then read before the simulation runs.\n\n\nThis snippet of code shows an example of how to initialize a configuration object:\n\n\n# \nInitialize\n \na\n \nconfig\n \nobject\n\n\nWBTConfigRobot\n \n=\n \nWBToolbox\n.\nWBToolboxConfig\n;\n\n\n# \nInsert\n \nrobot\n \ndata\n\n\nWBTConfigRobot\n.\nRobotName\n \n=\n \nicubSim\n;\n\n\nWBTConfigRobot\n.\nUrdfFile\n \n=\n \nmodel.urdf\n;\n\n\nWBTConfigRobot\n.\nControlledJoints\n \n=\n \n{\n...\n\n    \ntorso_pitch\n,\ntorso_roll\n,\ntorso_yaw\n,\n...\n\n    \nr_shoulder_pitch\n,\nr_shoulder_roll\n,\nr_shoulder_yaw\n,\nr_elbow\n,\n...\n\n    \nl_shoulder_pitch\n,\nl_shoulder_roll\n,\nl_shoulder_yaw\n,\nl_elbow\n};\n\n\nWBTConfigRobot\n.\nControlBoardsNames\n \n=\n \n{\ntorso\n,\nleft_arm\n,\nright_arm\n};\n\n\nWBTConfigRobot\n.\nLocalName\n \n=\n \nWBT\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nTo check if the data has been read correctly, it is displayed as read-only in the block's mask.\n\n\nFurthermore, a good sign for a valid configuration is the \nWBTConfigRobot.ValidConfiguration\n property.\n\n\nMulti-robot support\n\n\nThe scope of the introduction of the \nConfiguration\n block goes beyond the need of a simpler toolbox configuration. One of the biggest limitation of the \n2.0\n version is the support of \ncontrolling only one robot per model\n.\n\n\nWB-Toolbox 3.0\n is now capable of reading / sending data from / to multiple robots. Multiple \nConfiguration\n blocks can be present in the same model attaining to the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nIn the same hierarchical level of a Simulink model, only one \nConfiguration\n\n block should be present. In other words, you should never see in the display more than one \nConfiguration\n block.\n\n\nConfiguration\n blocks put deeper in the hierarchy (e.g. in a Subsystem) override the previous ones.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few pitfalls which are worth to be highlighted:\n\n\n\n\nIt is legit having two Subsystems with different \nConfiguration\n blocks which point to the same robot. They can have for instance a different joint list and use different control boards. Although, despite reading information never creates problems, sending data to the robot in such scenario can be disastrous. In fact, consider the case these two subsystems share one link, and configure it in two different control modes (e.g. Position and Torque). Sending references to this link causes unpredictable effects.\n\n\nIn line of theory it would be possible to have two subsystems in which the first one refers to a Gazebo model and the second one to a real robot. However, this case causes unpredictable behaviour for what concerns the synchronization. In fact, two different blocks for such aim are present in the toolbox: \nSimulator Synchronizer\n and \nReal Time Syncronizer\n. They should be always used exclusively.\n\n\n\n\nOther manual edits\n\n\n\n\nAll the \nGet Estimate\n blocks need to be replaced by the new \nGet Measurement\n block.\n\n\nAll the hardcoded digital filters (e.g. for the joints velocities) have been removed. A new \nDiscrete Filter\n block has been developed, and it should be manually added if the read raw signal (e.g. from the \nGet Measurement\n block) requires filtering.\n\n\nThe \nC++\n class used by the \nDoFs Converter\n changed. All the blocks in the \nYARP To WBI\n configuration need to be connected again.\n\n\nThe gravity vector is stored is the \nWBToolboxConfig\n class. If an alternative value is needed, set it globally directly in the configuration object or scope the block which needs it in a Subsystem with its own \nConfiguration\n block.\n\n\nIn order to set the low level PIDs, loading in the Workspace a \nWBToolbox.WBTPIDConfig\n object should be configured as follows:\n\n\n\n\n# \nInitialize\n \nan\n \nempty\n \nobject\n\n\npids\n \n=\n \nWBToolbox\n.\nWBTPIDConfig\n;\n\n\n# \nInsert\n \ndata\n\n\npids\n.\naddPID\n(\nWBToolbox\n.\nPID\n(\nl_elbow\n,\n \nWBToolbox\n.\nPID\n(\n1\n,\n \n1\n,\n \n0\n)));\n\n\npids\n.\naddPID\n(\nWBToolbox\n.\nPID\n(\nl_wrist_pitch\n,\n \nWBToolbox\n.\nPID\n(\n1.5\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n0.1\n)));\n\n\npids\n.\naddPID\n(\nWBToolbox\n.\nPID\n(\nr_shoulder_pitch\n,\n \nWBToolbox\n.\nPID\n(\n0.2\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n0\n)));\n\n\npids\n.\naddPID\n(\nWBToolbox\n.\nPID\n(\ntorso_roll\n,\n \nWBToolbox\n.\nPID\n(\n0.1\n,\n \n0.1\n,\n \n0\n)));\n\n\n\n\n\nIf some of the controlled joints are not specified, the PIDs are kept in their default values.\n\n\nDeprecations\n\n\n\n\nInverse Kinematics\n and \nRemote Inverse Kinematics\n have been temporary deprecated. They will see a major release in the coming months. If you need them please do not upgrade to the \n3.0\n version.\n\n\nSet Low Level PID\n block lost the capability of switching between multiple configurations.

This snippet of code shows an example of how to initialize a configuration object:  #  Initialize   a   config   object  WBTConfigRobot   =   WBToolbox . WBToolboxConfig ; \n\n#  Insert   robot   data  WBTConfigRobot . RobotName   =   icubSim ;  WBTConfigRobot . UrdfFile   =   model.urdf ;  WBTConfigRobot . ControlledJoints   =   { ... \n     torso_pitch , torso_roll , torso_yaw , ... \n     r_shoulder_pitch , r_shoulder_roll , r_shoulder_yaw , r_elbow , ... \n     l_shoulder_pitch , l_shoulder_roll , l_shoulder_yaw , l_elbow };  WBTConfigRobot . ControlBoardsNames   =   { torso , left_arm , right_arm };  WBTConfigRobot . LocalName   =   WBT ;   To check if the data has been read correctly, it is displayed as read-only in the block's mask.  Furthermore, a good sign for a valid configuration is the  WBTConfigRobot.ValidConfiguration  property.",

            "text": "The scope of the introduction of the  Configuration  block goes beyond the need of a simpler toolbox configuration. One of the biggest limitation of the  2.0  version is the support of  controlling only one robot per model .  WB-Toolbox 3.0  is now capable of reading / sending data from / to multiple robots. Multiple  Configuration  blocks can be present in the same model attaining to the following rules:   In the same hierarchical level of a Simulink model, only one  Configuration \n block should be present. In other words, you should never see in the display more than one  Configuration  block.  Configuration  blocks put deeper in the hierarchy (e.g. in a Subsystem) override the previous ones.   There are a few pitfalls which are worth to be highlighted:   It is legit having two Subsystems with different  Configuration  blocks which point to the same robot. They can have for instance a different joint list and use different control boards. Although, despite reading information never creates problems, sending data to the robot in such scenario can be disastrous. In fact, consider the case these two subsystems share one link, and configure it in two different control modes (e.g. Position and Torque). Sending references to this link causes unpredictable effects.  In line of theory it would be possible to have two subsystems in which the first one refers to a Gazebo model and the second one to a real robot. However, this case causes unpredictable behaviour for what concerns the synchronization. In fact, two different blocks for such aim are present in the toolbox:  Simulator Synchronizer  and  Real Time Syncronizer . They should be always used exclusively.",

            "text": "All the  Get Estimate  blocks need to be replaced by the new  Get Measurement  block.  All the hardcoded digital filters (e.g. for the joints velocities) have been removed. A new  Discrete Filter  block has been developed, and it should be manually added if the read raw signal (e.g. from the  Get Measurement  block) requires filtering.  The  C++  class used by the  DoFs Converter  changed. All the blocks in the  YARP To WBI  configuration need to be connected again.  The gravity vector is stored is the  WBToolboxConfig  class. If an alternative value is needed, set it globally directly in the configuration object or scope the block which needs it in a Subsystem with its own  Configuration  block.  In order to set the low level PIDs, loading in the Workspace a  WBToolbox.WBTPIDConfig  object should be configured as follows:   #  Initialize   an   empty   object  pids   =   WBToolbox . WBTPIDConfig ; \n\n#  Insert   data  pids . addPID ( WBToolbox . PID ( l_elbow ,   WBToolbox . PID ( 1 ,   1 ,   0 )));  pids . addPID ( WBToolbox . PID ( l_wrist_pitch ,   WBToolbox . PID ( 1.5 ,   0 ,   0.1 )));  pids . addPID ( WBToolbox . PID ( r_shoulder_pitch ,   WBToolbox . PID ( 0.2 ,   0 ,   0 )));  pids . addPID ( WBToolbox . PID ( torso_roll ,   WBToolbox . PID ( 0.1 ,   0.1 ,   0 )));   If some of the controlled joints are not specified, the PIDs are kept in their default values.",
