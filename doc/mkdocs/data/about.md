`WB-Toolbox` has been developed in the [Dynamic Interaction Control](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/dynamic-interaction-control) research line at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it).

It was born from the ashes of @robotology-playground/WBI-Toolbox.

It is used extensively for controllers stored in @robotology-playground/whole-body-controllers.
