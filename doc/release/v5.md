# Whole-Body Toolbox (YYYY-MM-DD) Release Notes {[`#v5`](https://github.com/robotology/wb-toolbox/releases/tag/v5)}

The `v5` release of Whole-Body Toolbox brings a big change in the architecture: the core of the toolbox became a standalone repository hosted at [robotology/blockfactory](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory). This repository will only provide a BlockFactory plugin.

More in detail, starting with this release `WBT` will contain only the following components:

- `WBToolboxBase` provides the base classes that simplify the interfacing with iDynTree and YARP libraries.
- `WBToolbox` is the real BlockFactory plugin, and it contains all the implementations of the `blockfactory::core::Block` interface.

## Important Changes

- The Core, Mex and Coder components have been removed
- New dependency: [robotology/blockfactory](https://github.com/robotology/blockfactory)
- If Matlab is found, the Simulink Library that wraps the block classes is installed
